# Pokemon3D
This is an app built with ARKit 2. The app can detect 2D images and render 3D augmented reality objects on top of those images. Also, these objects are attached to the images, so when the users move the images, the 3D AR objects move with them. In other words, the 3D AR images will be able to stay relative to those images.

Note: The users need to have a physical iOS device such as iPad and iPhone in order to run this app because the simulator do not have the camera function. Therefore, I added the 3D pokemon objects below. When the users run this app on their physical iPhone or iPad, they can see these objects on 2D images (such as playing cards) as attached to them.
